# Data Engineering Network

## What is Data Engineering?
Data Engineering is a fast-growing and increasingly important discipline in Government, focusing on ingesting, transforming, and delivering departmental data to the right places, in an efficient and automated way.

## Who are we?
The Data Engineering Network is a community of Data Engineers who are working in the UK Public Sector. The community is open to anyone who is working in data engineering or related fields in government. We are focused on promoting knowledge sharing, collaboration, and career development opportunities among data professionals. 


## What are our goals?
- To provide a platform for members to share their experiences of tackling specific data engineering problems.
- To promote knowledge sharing and collaboration among professionals engaged with Data Engineering.
- To encourage the use of modern data engineering tools and technologies in the public sector.
- To provide opportunities for members to learn about new data engineering trends, techniques, and tools.
- To create a supportive community that fosters collaboration, innovation, and growth.


## What activities are planned?
- Regular knowledge sharing events, where members can discuss practical experiences of tackling data engineering problems in their government departments.
- Regular ‘coffee and code’ style workshops (ETL & Espresso) to facilitate discussion on data engineering topics within the community. Online forums for members to share knowledge and ask for help
- Larger, face-to-face opportunities for members to network.
- Newsletter/ Regular updates on ongoing activities, latest in the world of data engineering in Government.
- Promotion of events and activity to each members’ own department and professional network.
